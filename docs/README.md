# Intro

There are lots of solana web3 examples here.

Feel free to open an issue for missing content.

::: tip

You will found some imports like below.

`import { CONNECTION, TEST_MINT, FEE_PAYER } from "../../../helper/const";`

This is for more focusing on the main topic. All const were defined [here](https://github.com/yihau/solana-web3-demo/blob/main/helper/const.ts)
